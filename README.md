# Heart Disease Data Analysis Project

**Overview:**
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data analysis project focused on heart disease. The dataset used in this project was downloaded from Kaggle and various data analysis techniques were applied to explore and understand the dataset.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used in this project contains information related to heart disease. It includes features such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, etc. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://github.com/akuldatt/Heart-Disease-Data-Set-Analysis/blob/main/heart.csv).

**Analysis Techniques:**

1. **Distplot:**
   - Distplot (Distribution Plot) was used to visualize the distribution of various variables in the dataset. This helped in understanding the spread and central tendency of the data.

2. **Pie Chart:**
   - Pie charts were created to represent the proportion of different categories within categorical variables, such as the distribution of heart disease across different age groups or genders.

3. **Correlation:**
   - Correlation analysis was performed to understand the relationships between different variables in the dataset. This helped in identifying potential predictors of heart disease and understanding how they relate to each other.

4. **Heatmap:**
   - A heatmap was plotted to visualize the correlation matrix of all variables in the dataset. This provided a clear overview of which variables are positively or negatively correlated with each other.

5. **Correlation Joint Graph:**
   - Correlation joint graphs were created to visualize the relationship between pairs of variables. This helped in understanding how two variables change together and whether there is any linear relationship between them.

6. **Correlation Pair Graph:**
   - Correlation pair graphs were plotted to visualize the pairwise relationships between all variables in the dataset. This provided a comprehensive view of the correlations between different features.

**Files:**

1. **data_analysis.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis.
2. **heart_disease_dataset.csv:** The dataset used for analysis.
3. **README.md:** This readme file providing an overview of the project.

**Usage:**
To replicate the analysis or explore the code, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (Python, Jupyter Notebook, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, etc.).
3. Open the `data_analysis.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code cells and visualize the results.
